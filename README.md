# WeatherGuard Pro: Real-Time Forecasting with Air Quality and Climate Preparedness
WeatherGuard Pro is an innovative Weather Forecasting Application designed to deliver accurate and real-time weather information for various locations. This comprehensive solution not only provides essential weather details but also incorporates Air Quality Index (AQI) and Heat Stress Index (HSI) levels, ensuring citizens are well-informed and prepared for climate conditions.

**Features:**
 - Accurate Weather Forecasting:
     - Utilizes real-time weather APIs for precise and detailed forecasts.
     - Employs machine learning algorithms to enhance weather predictions.
 - Air Quality Index (AQI) Monitoring:
     - Measures AQI levels using data from environmental sensors.
 - Heat Stress Index (HSI) Analysis:
     - Calculates HSI based on temperature, humidity, and wind conditions.
 - Web Interface Development:
     - Implements Flask and Django to create an intuitive web interface.
     - Utilizes HTML5 and CSS3 for responsive and interactive design.
 - Machine Learning Models:
     - Trains models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient-Boosted Trees for performance prediction.
 - Data Storage & Management:
     - Utilizes MySQL for storing and managing weather and environmental data.
     - Implements SQL databases for efficient data retrieval.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the Repository:
  - Run git clone https://github.com/tstazbid/WeatherGuard-Pro.
2. Install Dependencies:
  - Execute pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the Flask Server:
  - Start the server with python server.py.
4. Access the Web Interface:
 - Open http://localhost:5000.
5. Explore Weather Information:
 - Use the web interface to check real-time weather details.
6. Check AQI and HSI:
 - View Air Quality Index (AQI) and Heat Stress Index (HSI) levels.


**Note:**
Ensure that necessary dependencies are installed, and the Flask application is run in a suitable environment.
